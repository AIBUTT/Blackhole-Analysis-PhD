# PhD_Code_CPP
BOOTSTRAP.C is the main code written in CPP to perform Data Analysis on CERN 2014 Dataset for my PhD thesis.

Title of my PhD thesis was "Search for Microscopic Black Holes in Multi-Jet Final-States using Multiple Single-Jet Triggers with ATLAS Detector with 8 TeV Proton-Proton Collisions at the Large Hadron Collider"

Remainder of the CPP, bash and text files are scripts written to produce plots from the Data obtained from performing the Data Analysis on CERN 2014 Dataset.
